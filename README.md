# Stock_Price_Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed closing prices, trading volumes, and daily returns for five major stocks.
Calculated and plotted moving averages against closing prices to identify trends and correlations.
Created a heatmap to visualize the correlation of percentage returns between the stocks.


Risk Analysis:

Performed statistical risk analysis methods.
Used Monte Carlo simulations to determine Value at Risk (VAR).
Applied Geometric Brownian Motion to simulate percentage changes in stock prices based on drift and shocks.


Machine Learning Models:

Evaluated machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost) to predict stock buy recommendations.
Utilized eight years of historical data for model training and testing.
Analyzed the performance of each model to assess their effectiveness in stock buy recommendations.
