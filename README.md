I have worked on a Stock Price Analysis project. The stock data was imported from Yahoo Finance. The project is broken down into three main sections: 
1. EDA
2. Risk Analysis
3. Machine Learning Modelling

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-	Analyzed closing prices, trading volumes, and daily returns for five major stocks.
-	Calculated and plotted moving averages against closing prices to identify trends and correlations.
-	Created a heatmap to visualize the correlation of percentage returns between the stocks.

Risk Analysis:
-	Performed statistical risk analysis methods.
-	Used Monte Carlo simulations to determine Value at Risk (VAR).
-	Applied Geometric Brownian Motion to simulate percentage changes in stock prices based on drift and shocks.

Machine Learning Models:
-	Evaluated machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, XGBoost) to predict stock buy recommendations.
-	Utilized eight years of historical data for model training and testing.
-	Analyzed the performance of each model to assess their effectiveness in stock buy recommendations.
